## CALIPER-Dataset

Data from the [CALIPER-Database](https://caliper.research.sickkids.ca/#/) with age-dependent reference intervals has been preloaded into this Shiny App. For this purpose, the data was brought into the appropriate shape for the analysis from the [Supplemental Table 2](https://academic.oup.com/clinchem/article/58/5/854/5620695#supplementary-data) from the publication: *Closing the Gaps in Pediatric Laboratory Reference Intervals: A CALIPER Database of 40 Biochemical Markers in a Healthy and Multiethnic Population of Children*.
